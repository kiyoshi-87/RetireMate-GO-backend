## About the Project

Retiremate is a retirement planning app that helps users to plan their finances for retirement. It provides 
- tools and calculators that assist users in determining how much they need to save for their retirement
- estimating their retirement income and,
- tracking their progress towards their retirement goals.

Retirement is the withdrawal from one's position or occupation or from one's active working life. Nowadays, most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age, funded by employers or the state.
In many poorer countries, there is no support for the elderly beyond that provided through the family. Thus in order to provide a platform where people can plan their retirement beforehand for a better 2nd innings of their life, we have created **RetireMate**.
